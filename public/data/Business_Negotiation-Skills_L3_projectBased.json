    "Project objective": "The Great Debate Tournament: A Test of Negotiation Skills and Wits",
    "Steps": [
      "Research the key concepts of Active Listening, Rapport Building, Assertiveness, Emotional Intelligence, and Adaptability. Take notes on each concept to help you understand their roles in successful negotiation and communication.",
      "Create a fun and interesting scenario where participants are tasked with preparing for a hypothetical debate tournament that focuses on enhancing their negotiation skills.",
      "Divide participants into pairs or small groups and assign each team a specific topic for their debate (e.g., the pros and cons of social media, the impact of technology on society, or the importance of environmental conservation).",
      "Instruct each team to research their assigned topic and develop arguments for both sides, ensuring they understand various perspectives and can present them effectively during the debate.",
      "Guide each team to practice Active Listening by conducting mock debates and encouraging them to listen attentively to their opponents' arguments, ask clarifying questions, and respond thoughtfully.",
      "Encourage teams to build rapport with their opponents by finding common ground, showing empathy, and using positive body language and tone of voice during the debate.",
      "Teach teams to demonstrate Assertiveness by expressing their viewpoints confidently and respectfully, while also being open to considering alternative perspectives.",
      "Emphasize the importance of Emotional Intelligence, guiding teams to recognize, understand, and manage their emotions during the debate, as well as empathize with their opponents' feelings.",
      "Highlight the concept of Adaptability, encouraging teams to be flexible in their approach and adjust their strategy based on their opponents' arguments, the flow of the debate, or new information that arises.",
      "Once all teams have completed their debate preparations, organize a round-robin tournament where each team debates against multiple opponents. After each debate, have participants provide constructive feedback on their opponents' negotiation skills, focusing on Active Listening, Rapport Building, Assertiveness, Emotional Intelligence, and Adaptability. Conclude the project by facilitating a debriefing session where participants discuss their experiences, share their insights on the negotiation skills, and reflect on the importance of these skills in both personal and professional settings."
