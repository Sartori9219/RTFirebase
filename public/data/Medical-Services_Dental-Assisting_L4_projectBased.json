    "Project objective": "Dental Defenders: A Mission to Save Smiles!",
    "Steps": [
      "Dental Anatomy: Start by researching the structure and function of teeth. Draw a tooth and label its parts, such as the crown, root, enamel, dentin, and pulp. Also, include the different types of teeth and their functions (incisors, canines, premolars, and molars).",
      "Oral Hygiene: Write a guide on good oral hygiene practices. Include the recommended technique for brushing and flossing, the importance of regular dental visits, and how diet affects oral health.",
      "Dental Instruments: Identify and describe the function of ten common dental instruments. Create a visual guide using images from the internet. Be sure to include tools like explorers, mirrors, probes, forceps, and elevators.",
      "Infection Control: Investigate the measures taken in a dental office to prevent the spread of infections. Describe personal protective equipment, sterilization methods for instruments, and proper disposal of biohazard waste.",
      "Dental Radiography: Learn about the purpose of dental X-rays and the safety precautions taken during their use. Describe the different types of dental X-rays and what they show.",
      "Once you have gathered all your information, begin drafting your field guide. Make sure it's organized and easy to understand.",
      "After drafting, use a computer program to design the guide. Make it visually engaging\u2014remember, it should be a quick-reference tool for the heroes!",
      "Once your field guide is complete, review it to make sure all the information is accurate and it's free of spelling or grammar errors.",
      "For a final touch, add a fun comic strip story at the end of your guide, showcasing a mini-adventure where Dental Defenders use the knowledge from your guide"

    "Project objective": "Toothville Chronicles: Behind the Scenes",
    "Steps": [
      "Research Phase: Start by researching the key concepts in the brief. This includes understanding the specifics of the tasks performed under each concept.",
      "Animation: Use an online tool to create an animated video based on your script and storyboard. Tools like Powtoon or Animaker can be used for free.",
      "Chairside Assisting & Patient Management: The first part of your documentary could depict the dental assistant preparing the patient and the work area for a procedure.",
      "Dental Materials & Laboratory Procedures: Transition into the discussion of different dental materials used for procedures and the lab processes that go into preparing them.",
      "Preventive Dentistry, Oral Pathology & Dental Emergencies: Dedicate a section to prevention methods and detection of oral diseases. Also, demonstrate how dental emergencies are handled.",
      "Orthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry & Office Management: Wrap up your documentary with a sneak peek into the world of orthodontics and pediatric dentistry. Also, include a snapshot of the administrative duties involved in office management.",
      "Editing: Once your animation is ready, spend time editing and refining the content. Remember to incorporate humor and make it engaging.",
      "Presentation: Once you're happy with your documentary, present it! You could also write a reflection on what you've learned about the role of a dental assistant during this project."
