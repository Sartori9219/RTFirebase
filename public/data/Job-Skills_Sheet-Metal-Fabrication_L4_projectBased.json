    "Project objective": "Sheet Metal Fabrication",
    "Steps": [
      "Begin by researching the basic process of sheet metal fabrication. Learn about the various stages, including cutting, bending, forming, and finishing. Write a brief summary of what you learn.",
      "Explore different types of sheet metal materials, such as stainless steel, copper, aluminum, and brass. Write down the unique properties of each material and why and where they might be used in fabrication.",
      "Research the various tools used in sheet metal fabrication, such as shears, brake presses, and punch presses. For each tool, describe its function and how it contributes to the fabrication process.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario #1: Pretend you are a product designer who needs to design a new lightweight, but durable, outdoor table using sheet metal. Draw a rough sketch of your design, labeling the type of metal you'd choose and why.",
      "Look into the safety precautions and measures that must be followed during sheet metal fabrication. Compile a list of safety guidelines that you would implement if you were running a fabrication workshop.",
      "Learn about the different techniques for finishing sheet metal products, such as grinding, sanding, and painting. Discuss the benefits of each technique and where it's most appropriately used.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario #2: Imagine you are an engineer in a sheet metal fabrication company and you've just been tasked to reduce the cost of production without compromising product quality. Write a proposal outlining your strategies.",
      "Research the impact of sheet metal fabrication on the environment. Identify potential problems and research possible solutions or alternatives that are being developed.",
      "Reflect on how sheet metal fabrication affects your everyday life. Look for objects around your house or school that may have been made through this process and discuss their importance.",
      "For your final step, create a digital presentation of everything you've learned about sheet metal fabrication. Include your design sketch, safety guidelines, cost-saving strategies, and reflection on the importance of this industry in everyday life."
