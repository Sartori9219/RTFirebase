    "Project objective": "World History of the 1700s:",
    "Steps": [
      "Begin by researching the global context of the 1700s. Identify the major empires, kingdoms, and societies that existed during this century and their relationships with each other.",
      "Select and study four significant events or developments from different parts of the world that occurred in the 1700s. Write a summary for each event detailing its causes, key figures, and consequences.",
      "From these four events, choose one that you find particularly compelling and explore it in more depth. Gather primary sources such as letters, diaries, treaties, or art from the time to gain different perspectives on the event.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario #1: Imagine you're an explorer during the 1700s and you've just discovered a previously unknown land. Write a letter home describing your discovery, the people or creatures you've encountered, and your hopes for future exploration or settlement.",
      "Identify and research three key scientific discoveries or technological innovations of the 1700s. Explain their significance and their impact on society at the time and into the future.",
      "Look into cultural and artistic movements of the 1700s. Pick one movement, research its origins, key contributors, and the impact it had on society.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario #2: Picture yourself as a prominent artist during the 1700s and you've been commissioned to create a work that embodies the spirit of the artistic movement you researched. Draft a proposal for this artwork, describing what you would create, the materials you would use, and how your piece represents the movement.",
      "Examine the major geopolitical changes that occurred during the 1700s. How did wars, treaties, and discoveries shape the world map? Use an online tool to visually depict these shifts.",
      "Reflect on how the developments and events of the 1700s continue to impact our world today. Write a thoughtful essay discussing the long-term effects of this century.",
      "Create a multimedia presentation that showcases your findings. This could be a video, an interactive timeline, or a digital poster, and should incorporate your summaries, hypothetical scenarios, visuals, and reflection."
