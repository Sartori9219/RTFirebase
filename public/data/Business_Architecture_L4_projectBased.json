    "Project objective": "Architecture",
    "Steps": [
      "Introduction to Architecture: Start your project by researching what architecture is and its importance. Learn about the different types of architecture, such as residential, commercial, and landscape architecture.",
      "Exploring Architectural Styles: Dive into the different architectural styles that have been popular throughout history, from Classical and Gothic to Modern and Postmodern styles. Pick a few that particularly interest you.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario - The Young Architect: Now, imagine that you're an architect who has been hired to design a public library in your local community. The city wants a building that will serve as a community hub, and it should also reflect the history and character of the local area.",
      "Understanding Your Building's Purpose: Start by researching what features and spaces are essential in a public library. What needs to be included in your design to ensure that the library serves its purpose well?",
      "Studying the Local Area: Learn about the history, culture, and character of your local area. How can these aspects be reflected in the design of your new library?",
      "Designing Your Building: Start drafting a basic design for your library. Use a digital tool to draw the layout, considering aspects like the number of floors, the layout of rooms, and where key features like bookshelves, study spaces, and computers will go.",
      "Incorporating Architectural Style: Choose an architectural style that you studied earlier, and incorporate elements of that style into your design. Explain why you chose this style and how it enhances your design.",
      "Sustainability in Architecture: Research how modern architecture considers sustainability. How can you incorporate sustainable elements into your design, such as energy-efficient features, use of natural light, or green spaces?",
      "Presenting Your Design: Once you've finalized your design, create a presentation that shows off your library. Explain your design choices and how your building serves its purpose, reflects the local area, and incorporates sustainability.",
      "Reflection and Learning: Reflect on what you have learned through this project about architecture. How have your views on buildings and their design changed? How might you look at your local buildings differently now? Write a summary of your project and your reflections."
