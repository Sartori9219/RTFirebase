    "Project objective": "Explore the world of nutrition by learning about macronutrients, micronutrients, Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), balanced diets, and food groups through a fun and engaging project.",
    "Steps": [
      "Pick a country or region that interests you. This will be the focus of your nutrition expedition.",
      "Research the three main macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Identify traditional dishes from your chosen country or region that are rich in each macronutrient.",
      "Investigate the essential micronutrients: vitamins and minerals. Find out which traditional foods from your chosen country or region are high in these micronutrients.",
      "Using your research on macronutrients and micronutrients, create a hypothetical meal plan for one day that includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks based on the traditional cuisine of your chosen country or region.",
      "Ensure that your meal plan follows the principles of a balanced diet by including the right proportions of macronutrients, micronutrients, and food groups.",
      "Identify the food groups present in each meal of your plan. Make sure you've included a variety of food groups throughout the day.",
      "Compare your meal plan to the DRIs you found earlier. Are you meeting the recommended intake for macronutrients and micronutrients? Adjust your plan accordingly.",
      "Create a visually appealing presentation (using PowerPoint, Prezi, or a similar tool) showcasing your research, meal plan, and DRI comparison. Add images, fun facts, and any other interesting information you discovered during your nutrition expedition.",
      "Present your project to your classmates, friends, or family members. Inspire them to embark on their own nutrition expeditions and learn about the importance of a balanced diet!"
