    "Project objective": "Delve into the world history of the 2000s:",
    "Steps": [
      "Start by researching an overview of the 2000s. Pay attention to major world events, significant cultural shifts, breakthroughs in science and technology, and influential figures.",
      "Select five major events that happened in the 2000s, one from each continent (Asia, Africa, North America, South America, and Europe). Write a brief summary of each event, detailing what happened, who was involved, and its impact.",
      "Take one event you found particularly interesting and dive deeper. Find at least three primary sources related to this event - these could be newspaper articles, interviews, speeches, or personal accounts.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario #1: Imagine you are a journalist who has been tasked with interviewing a key figure involved in the event you chose. Write a list of ten questions you would ask to get a deeper understanding of their perspective and role in the event.",
      "Identify three significant cultural or societal shifts that occurred during the 2000s. Discuss what caused these changes and how they affected the world at large.",
      "Choose a scientific or technological breakthrough from the 2000s. Research its development and impact on society, and discuss why it was significant.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario #2: Picture yourself as an inventor in the 2000s. You've just come up with a groundbreaking technology that could change the world. Write a pitch to potential investors, explaining what your invention does, why it's revolutionary, and how it will impact society.",
      "Take a look at global leaders during the 2000s. Select one leader and write a profile about them. What were their major contributions and challenges during their tenure?",
      "Reflect on how the events and developments of the 2000s have shaped the world today. Write a one-page reflection discussing your thoughts.",
      "Create a timeline of the 2000s. Include the major events, cultural shifts, and technological advancements you've researched. This timeline should not only be informative, but also visually engaging. You can use online tools like Canva or Prezi for this task.",
      "This project should provide a comprehensive look into the pivotal moments and shifts of the 2000s, enhancing your understanding of this significant decade in world history."
