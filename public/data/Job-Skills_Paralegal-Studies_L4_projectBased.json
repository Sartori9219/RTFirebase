    "Project objective": "Paralegal Prodigy: Time-travel to Solve Legal Mysteries!",
    "Steps": [
      "Initiation: Film a fun video where you \"find\" the magical law book and explain its powers and your mission.",
      "Legal Language Training: Create a \"paralegal dictionary\" defining 20 legal terms you expect to encounter in your journeys.",
      "Time-Travel Preparation: Choose three distinct historical eras and locations (e.g., Colonial America, Ancient Rome, Victorian England). Research the legal systems, common crimes, and civil issues of each era.",
      "Legal Research: Dive into a significant legal case from each chosen era. Document the facts, laws, and outcomes of these cases in your \"time-travel journal.\"",
      "Legal Writing: Write a legal brief for each case as if you were the paralegal preparing it for the lawyer. The brief should summarize the facts, the law, and your proposed argument.",
      "Civil Procedure: For one case, outline the civil procedure that would have been followed. Write a timeline of events from the complaint to the verdict.",
      "Criminal Procedure: For another case, detail the criminal procedure. Again, create a timeline from the arrest to the verdict.",
      "Role-Play: Act out a scene from one of the cases you researched where you present your legal brief to the \"lawyer\" (a friend or family member). Record this role-play and provide a brief explanation of the scene for viewers.",
      "Legal Reflection: Write a reflective essay about your experiences as a time-traveling paralegal. What were the most challenging aspects, and what did you learn about legal processes across different eras and cultures?",
      "Presentation: Compile all your project's elements (video, dictionary, journal, legal briefs, timelines, role-play, and essay) into a digital presentation. You could use a tool like Prezi or Google Slides."
