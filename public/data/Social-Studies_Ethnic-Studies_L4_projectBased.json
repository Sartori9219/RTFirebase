    "Steps": [
      "Discover Ethnic Studies: Begin by researching the basics of ethnic studies. Understand what the field is about, its significance, and how it evolved over time. Pay attention to the various ethnic groups studied and the societal issues that are often explored.",
      "Pick an Ethnic Group: Choose a specific ethnic group that you want to focus on for this project. It could be a group that you're part of, one that you're interested in, or one that you know little about and want to explore further.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario - The Film Producer: Now, imagine that you are a film producer planning to make a documentary about the ethnic group you've chosen. Your goal is to portray the history, culture, challenges, and contributions of this group accurately and respectfully.",
      "History and Background: Deepen your understanding of your chosen ethnic group by researching its history and background. Who are they? Where did they originate? What is their migration story, if any? How have their lives and communities changed over time?",
      "Culture and Traditions: Learn about the culture and traditions of the ethnic group. Explore their language, religion, art, music, festivals, clothing, food, and other cultural elements that make them unique.",
      "Challenges and Triumphs: Investigate the challenges this group has faced and continues to face, such as discrimination, inequality, or other social issues. Also, explore the group's achievements, contributions, and how they've overcome some of these challenges.",
      "Documentary Script: Using your research, write a script for your documentary. Ensure the script is informative, respectful, and interesting, offering viewers an in-depth look into the ethnic group's history, culture, challenges, and triumphs.",
      "Storyboard Creation: Next, create a storyboard for your documentary. While you may not be able to film it, you can sketch out the main scenes or use digital tools to design it. Include a brief description for each scene.",
      "Present Your Project: Share your script and storyboard with classmates, family members, or friends. You can do this virtually, such as through a video call. Ask for their feedback to understand different perspectives.",
      "Reflection on the Project: Reflect on what you've learned from this project about your chosen ethnic group and ethnic studies in general. What did you find most interesting? What was challenging? How has this project shaped your understanding of diversity and multiculturalism? Write a conclusion that summarizes your thoughts and learnings."
