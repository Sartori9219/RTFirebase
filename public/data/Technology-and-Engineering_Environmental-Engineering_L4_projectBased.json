    "Steps": [
      "Imagine a city, let's call it Smogville. It's notorious for its polluted air, contaminated soil, unmanaged waste, and unclean water. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to transform Smogville into a sustainable, pollution-free city.",
      "Research different water treatment methods. Sketch a design for a water treatment facility that can clean Smogville's water supply effectively and sustainably.",
      "Investigate various methods of air pollution control. How can these methods be incorporated into Smogville's factories, homes, and transport systems?",
      "Explore techniques for soil remediation. Consider how you could apply these to the contaminated parks and recreational areas of Smogville.",
      "Investigate modern waste management techniques. What changes could be made to Smogville's current waste disposal methods to make them more efficient and less harmful to the environment?",
      "Learn about the principles of sustainable design. How can these principles guide the overall planning and development of Smogville?",
      "Using online software or drawing tools, create a map of Smogville showing the existing problems and your proposed solutions, including the locations of your water treatment facility, air pollution control devices, soil remediation areas, and waste management centers.",
      "Research the estimated costs of your proposed changes. Remember, your plan needs to be financially feasible for it to be implemented.",
      "Prepare a presentation to convince Smogville's city council (your classmates or teacher) to adopt your plan. Be sure to explain the benefits of each change and how it will contribute to a healthier, more sustainable city.",
      "Reflect on any feedback you receive from your presentation. How can you improve your plan? Revisit your Smogville map and make any necessary adjustments to your proposed solutions."

    "Steps": [
      "Your hometown, Hazardville, has been affected by hazardous waste pollution. As a young environmentalist, you're determined to transform Hazardville into an eco-friendly utopia. Gear up for the mission!",
      "Carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of Hazardville. Identify the sources of pollution, the affected areas, and the impact of pollution on the local community and wildlife.",
      "Research hazardous waste management techniques. Design a system for Hazardville to manage its hazardous waste effectively and safely.",
      "Get familiar with environmental law and policy. Identify the laws and regulations that could support your mission in Hazardville. Also, identify gaps in current laws that need to be addressed.",
      "Research the principles of green building. Design a model of a green building that could serve as a model for future construction in Hazardville.",
      "Create a digital map of Hazardville showing the existing issues and your proposed solutions. Include the locations of hazardous waste, water resources, and your proposed green building.",
      "Estimate the costs and benefits of your proposed changes. Your plan needs to be economically viable for the city council to consider it.",
      "Prepare a persuasive presentation for the Hazardville city council (your classmates or teacher). Highlight how your plan will benefit the environment and the community.",
      "Reflect on the feedback you receive from your presentation. How can you improve your plan? Revise your map and solutions based on the feedback."
