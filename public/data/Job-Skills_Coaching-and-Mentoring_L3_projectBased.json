      "Develop an avatar representing you on Mars. This could be a drawing, a computer graphic, or a fun description. This avatar will become your identity for the rest of the project.",
      "Devise a \"Martian Motivation Mantra\" to help keep you encouraged throughout this process. Write it down and put it somewhere you can see it every day.",
      "Take a week to notice your patterns, behaviors, and feelings as you work toward your goals. Write down any insights you gain about yourself in your journal. This is your Martian self-awareness log.",
      "Use your previously designed problem-solving techniques to tackle any issues or setbacks you face in achieving your goals. Reflect on the process in your journal.",
      "Imagine a situation where you have to convey an important message to your fellow Martians. It could be a change in plans, a warning, or a proposal. How would you ensure your message is clear and understandable?",
      "Reflect on the entire process so far. How well did you manage your time? How effective were your problem-solving techniques? What did you learn about yourself?",
      "Create a presentation or a video summarizing your journey, achievements, and learnings. This is your chance to showcase your Martian life skills to the producers and secure your spot on \"Space-Time-Life Balance.\""

    "Steps": [
      "To begin your journey, create a superhero persona for yourself, complete with a cool superhero name. This persona represents the best version of you.",
      "Every superhero has a power. Reflect on your strengths and decide what your superpower would be. It could be related to emotional intelligence, decision-making, or conflict resolution.",
      "You have just received two missions from IATS, but you can only choose one due to time constraints. One is to rescue a cat stuck on a tree and another is to help an elderly person cross the road. Using a decision-making strategy, decide which mission you'll undertake and justify your choice.",
      "Identify a real or fictional character who embodies the qualities you would like to develop. Research their life, actions, and traits. How did they demonstrate emotional intelligence? How did they resolve conflicts?",
      "For one week, keep a diary of your emotional responses to different situations. At the end of the week, analyze this diary for patterns and insights. This is your 'Emotional Intelligence Meter'.",
      "Using insights from your Emotional Intelligence Meter, reflect on how you could have better managed your emotions in one of the situations you noted down. Write a revised response in your journal.",
      "Choose one characteristic from your role model that you want to incorporate into your behavior. Practice this trait for a week, and note any changes you observe in yourself or in how others respond to you.",
      "Prepare a mission debriefing report for IATS. In this report, include your secret identity, your superpower, your experience with conflict resolution and decision-making, your role model, and your personal development plan."
