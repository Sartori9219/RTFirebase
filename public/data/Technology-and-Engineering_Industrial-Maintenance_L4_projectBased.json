    "Project objective": "Building a Better Mousetrap: Maintenance for the Industrial Age",
    "Steps": [
      "Getting to Know Industrial Maintenance: Begin by researching the basics of industrial maintenance. Understand the skills and knowledge required to maintain a factory's various systems.",
      "Mechanical Systems Mastery: Dive deep into the mechanics of industrial machinery. Identify the key mechanical systems and components in the cheese factory, and how they may be exploited by a mouse with a wrench.",
      "Electrifying Electrical Knowledge: Learn about the electrical systems and components in an industrial setting. Find out what could potentially go wrong (apart from a mouse chewing on the wires, that is).",
      "Hydraulic Systems Hustle: Understand hydraulic systems and components. These systems are a bit like a mousetrap in their own way, so tread carefully!",
      "Mechanical Mouseproofing: Develop a plan to improve the maintenance of the mechanical systems in the factory, reducing the potential for mouse interference.",
      "Electrical Exclusion Zones: Create a strategy for maintaining and protecting the factory's electrical systems, keeping them free of mice.",
      "Hydraulic Havoc Prevention: Plan measures to prevent mice from meddling with the factory's hydraulic systems.",
      "Project Report: Prepare a detailed report outlining your plans for each system, including diagrams and explanations of your proposed maintenance routines.",
      "Presentation: Present your strategies to the class, explaining how your plans not only maintain the factory systems but also prevent any mouse-made mechanical mishaps."

    "Project objective": "The Balloon-Powered City: A Pneumatic Odyssey",
    "Steps": [
      "Learning the Ropes: Begin by researching the basics of pneumatic systems and components. Understand how they work and how they could be used to power a city.",
      "Preventive Measures: Learn about preventive maintenance and inspection. Create a preventative maintenance schedule for the city's main pneumatic power station.",
      "Problem-Solving Prowess: Research various methods for troubleshooting and problem-solving in the context of pneumatic systems. Identify common issues that could arise in a city powered by balloons.",
      "Lubrication and Bearings: Investigate the role of lubrication and bearings in mechanical systems. Learn how they contribute to the smooth operation of pneumatic systems.",
      "Welding Wonders: Delve into the world of welding and fabrication. Understand how these processes are involved in creating and maintaining the infrastructure of a pneumatic city.",
      "Pneumatic City Blueprint: Draw up a blueprint for a key part of Balloonville, like a balloon-powered monorail or pneumatic trash disposal system. Include specifications for pneumatic components, lubrication points, bearings, and fabrication needs.",
      "Preventive Maintenance Plan: Based on your blueprint, develop a comprehensive preventive maintenance and inspection plan.",
      "Troubleshooting Guide: Create a troubleshooting guide for the most likely problems that your chosen city system might encounter.",
      "Presentation: Finally, compile your findings into a presentation. Explain the design, preventive maintenance plan, troubleshooting guide, and the importance of welding and fabrication in your pneumatic city system."

    "Project objective": "The Sushi Conveyor Belt: A PLC Powered Marvel",
    "Steps": [
      "Motor Madness: Start by learning about pumps and motors, and their application in conveyor systems. Focus on understanding the kind of motors that are used in conveyor belts in restaurants.",
      "Conveyor System Symphony: Research different types of conveyor systems and their components. Understand the mechanics behind how they transport sushi plates.",
      "PLC Power: Get familiar with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), how they work, and their role in controlling conveyor belts.",
      "Energy Efficiency Exploration: Investigate concepts of energy efficiency and management, especially with respect to conveyor systems. Look for ways to make your design eco-friendly and cost-effective.",
      "Career Considerations: Research various career opportunities in the field of industrial maintenance. Understand the roles, responsibilities, and qualifications required for these jobs.",
      "PLC Program Plan: Outline a basic program for your PLC that would control the conveyor system. Include start-stop controls, speed control, and a system to keep track of the number of plates served.",
      "Energy Management Strategy: Develop an energy management strategy for your sushi conveyor system. This could include energy-efficient motors, strategic operation times, and automatic power saving modes.",
      "Career Mapping: Based on your research, decide on a role in industrial maintenance that you find most interesting. Write a short essay about why you're interested in this career, what qualifications you'll need, and how this project helped you understand the role better.",
      "Final Presentation: Compile all your work into a presentation. Include your conveyor system design, PLC program outline, energy management strategy, and career aspirations. Don't forget to add a pinch of humor \u2013 maybe by adding a sushi character as your mascot!"
