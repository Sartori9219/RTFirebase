      "Over the next week, make a conscious effort to say please and thank you in appropriate situations. Record each instance (who, where, when, what) in your manners diary.",
      "Your next mission is to hold doors open for others. Again, keep a record in your manners diary.",
      "Now, demonstrate your listening skills by engaging in conversations where you listen more than you speak. Make note of the other person's reactions.",
      "In your interactions with others, ensure you respect their personal space. Remember, not everyone is comfortable with close proximity!",
      "When speaking with others, practice making appropriate eye contact. This shows respect and attentiveness.",
      "Now that you have your records, begin sketching your comic strip. Each 'good manners' mission can be a separate story, or they can be combined.",
      "Design your main character (you, the secret agent), and any recurring characters you interacted with during your missions.",
      "Use humor, suspense, and creativity to make your comic strip engaging. Don't forget to include the reactions of others to your good manners.",
      "Incorporate the use of please, thank you, and other polite phrases in the dialogue. Show how good listening skills can make conversations more meaningful.",
      "Review your comic strip. Is the message of the importance of good manners clear? If not, make the necessary adjustments. Once you're satisfied, share your comic strip with friends or family."

    "Steps": [
      "For the next few days, seek out opportunities to offer help to others. How did it feel? How did they respond? Update your blog with these experiences.",
      "Travel through your day focusing on using polite and respectful language. Note any changes in how people interact with you in your blog.",
      "Your next mission is all about food! Whether it's at home, a friend's place, or a restaurant, demonstrate your knowledge of good table manners. Share your experiences in your blog - feel free to make it humorous or dramatic!",
      "For the next week, make a conscious effort to be punctual for all your commitments. Note how it affects your stress levels and the responses of others.",
      "Upload your creative reflection to your blog. Explain the context and your learnings.",
      "Choose a historical period and research about the etiquette and manners of that era. Write a blog post comparing it with modern manners.",
      "Now, imagine the future. How do you think manners might change? Will any remain the same? Write a speculative blog post about it.",
      "Write a final blog post summarizing your adventure in good manners. Reflect on what you've learned and how you'll continue practicing these manners."

    "Project objective": "The Social Scientist: An Expedition into Respectful Interactions",
    "Steps": [
      "For the first few days, make a conscious effort to respect others' opinions, even if they differ from yours. Record your thoughts and experiences in an audio journal to be used for your podcast.",
      "Focus on being aware of situations where an apology might be necessary, and take the initiative to apologize. Reflect on the reactions you receive and how it makes you feel.",
      "Make a strict rule to keep your phone on silent during class or meetings. Note any changes in your concentration or participation, as well as any comments from teachers or peers.",
      "Commit to avoiding gossip and rumors. How hard was it? Did you notice any changes in your interactions? Record your observations.",
      "For the next few days, express your gratitude and appreciation to people around you. Document the reactions you receive and how it affects your mood and relationships.",
      "Continue producing your podcast series, dedicating each episode to the concept you focused on that week.",
      "For one episode, create a fun segment where you impersonate different personalities navigating these social situations. Humor is encouraged!",
      "Invite listeners to share their own experiences with these concepts. Include a few of these stories in an episode, if possible.",
      "In your final episode, reflect on the project as a whole. What were the highlights? What did you learn? How have these experiments affected your social interactions?"
