      "Pick out the statement that uses Ad Hominem. Explain why it's a fallacy, and rewrite the argument in a way that makes it logically sound.",
      "Identify the statement that uses the Straw Man fallacy. Explain its faulty logic and present a valid version of the argument.",
      "Locate the Appeal to Authority fallacy. Explain why it's misleading and then recreate the statement without the fallacy.",
      "Find the Slippery Slope fallacy. Describe why it's problematic and offer a more logically sound argument.",
