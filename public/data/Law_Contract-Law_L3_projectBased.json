    "Project objective": "The Great Classroom Market: A Contract Law Exploration",
    "Steps": [
      "Choose a unique product or service that you would like to offer in the classroom market (e.g., custom-designed bookmarks, tutoring sessions, or personalized poems).",
      "Research the cost of materials or resources needed to create your product or provide your service. Calculate a fair price for your offering based on this information.",
      "Create a visually appealing advertisement for your product or service. Include a clear offer, the price, and any terms or conditions associated with the purchase. Print out the advertisement.",
      "Present your advertisement to the class. Explain the concept of \"Offer\" using your advertisement as an example. Discuss the importance of clarity in the offer and how it affects the contract formation process.",
      "Pair up with a classmate who is interested in exchanging their product or service with yours. Discuss the concept of \"Acceptance\" as you mutually agree to proceed with the exchange.",
      "Identify the benefits each party will receive from the exchange \u2013 this is the \"Consideration\" aspect of the contract. Make sure both parties understand and agree upon the consideration involved.",
      "Discuss the importance of \"Legal Capacity\" in contracts. Ensure both parties are capable of entering into a legally binding agreement (e.g., no underage or mentally incapacitated individuals).",
      "Confirm that both parties have a \"Mutual Assent\" by openly discussing the terms and conditions of the contract. Ensure that both parties fully understand and agree to the terms.",
      "Draft a simple written contract outlining the Offer, Acceptance, Consideration, Legal Capacity, and Mutual Assent aspects of the agreement. Both parties should sign and date the contract.",
      "Complete the exchange as agreed upon in the contract. Reflect on the experience and discuss what you've learned about contract law through this hands-on activity. Share your insights with the class.",

    "Project objective": "The Contract Chronicles: A Creative Exploration of Contract Types and Principles",
    "Steps": [
      "Divide a sheet of paper into five sections, each labeled with one of the following contract concepts: Legality, Written vs. Oral Contracts, Express vs. Implied Contracts, Unilateral vs. Bilateral Contracts, and Void, Voidable, and Unenforceable Contracts.",
      "Research each concept using reliable online sources, such as legal websites or educational resources. Take brief notes on each concept in its corresponding section on your divided sheet of paper.",
      "Choose a fictional scenario for each concept that would make for an interesting and engaging short story (e.g., a superhero negotiating a contract with a city to protect it from villains, or a time-traveler making agreements with people from different centuries).",
      "For each scenario, write a brief outline of how the chosen contract concept plays a central role in the story. Make sure to incorporate the key aspects of the concept into your outline.",
      "Draft a short story based on one of your outlines. Be creative and use humor to make the story engaging while also illustrating the chosen contract concept.",
      "Revise your short story based on the feedback you received from your classmate. Make any necessary changes to ensure the contract concept is clear and well-represented in the story.",
      "Compile your short stories into a collection titled \"The Contract Chronicles.\" Create a cover page and a table of contents that lists each story and its corresponding contract concept.",
      "Present your collection of short stories to the class. Discuss the different contract concepts and how you incorporated them into your creative writing. Share any insights or lessons learned from the project."

    "Project objective": "The Great Escape Room: A Contract Law Adventure",
    "Steps": [
      "Research examples of escape rooms and their puzzles online. Select five puzzles, each representing one of the following contract law concepts: Breach of Contract, Remedies for Breach of Contract, Specific Performance, Termination of Contracts, and Contract Interpretation.",
      "Draft a creative, hypothetical scenario in which a group of students must solve these puzzles to \"escape\" a room. The scenario should involve a series of contracts or agreements between the characters that incorporate the chosen contract law concepts.",
      "Create a detailed outline of the escape room scenario, including descriptions of the puzzles and how they connect to the contract law concepts.",
      "Gather the necessary materials and props to set up the escape room environment in a classroom or other suitable space.",
      "Write clear instructions for each puzzle, making sure to highlight the relevant contract law concept. Print out the instructions and place them in the appropriate locations within the escape room.",
      "Invite a group of classmates to participate in the escape room adventure. Provide them with the necessary background information about the scenario and explain the rules of the game.",
      "Observe the participants as they work through the puzzles, taking note of their problem-solving strategies and any difficulties they encounter.",
      "After the participants have successfully completed the escape room, facilitate a debriefing session in which they discuss their experiences and the contract law concepts they encountered.",
      "Have participants reflect on the concepts they learned during the escape room activity, and ask them to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the puzzles in teaching these concepts.",
      "Based on the feedback received, revise and improve the escape room scenario and puzzles as needed. Share the revised version with other classmates or groups for further learning and exploration of the contract law concepts."
