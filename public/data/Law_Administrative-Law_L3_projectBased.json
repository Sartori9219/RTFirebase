    "Project objective": "Administrative Law",
    "Steps": [
      "Introduction to Administrative Law: Start by researching what administrative law is, its importance, and its role in a country's legal system. This includes learning about the agencies that enforce these laws, the administrative procedures in place, and how it affects everyday life.",
      "Understanding Regulatory Agencies: Dive deeper into the different types of regulatory agencies. Learn about their functions, how they're organized, and their role in implementing laws and regulations.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario - Environmental Crusader: Imagine you're an environmental crusader trying to get a new regulation passed that would limit the amount of plastic waste produced by businesses in your city. You want to understand how administrative law might help you achieve your goal.",
      "Researching Relevant Administrative Bodies: Identify and research the local and national administrative bodies that would have jurisdiction over your proposed regulation. This could include environmental protection agencies or city councils.",
      "Outline the Law Making Process: Outline the process of how a new regulation like your proposed plastic waste limitation would be passed within the system of administrative law. This would include how it would be proposed, reviewed, and enacted.",
      "Draft Your Proposed Regulation: Write a detailed proposal for your plastic waste regulation. Be sure to include the problem you're addressing, the specifics of the proposed law, and why you believe it's necessary and beneficial.",
      "Identifying Potential Objections: Research and anticipate potential objections to your proposed regulation. Who might oppose it, and why? This could include businesses affected by the regulation, or individuals concerned about the impact on prices or the economy.",
      "Developing Arguments for Your Regulation: Develop arguments to counter the potential objections to your regulation. Use facts and logical reasoning to strengthen your case.",
      "Imagine the Regulation Passes: Now imagine that your proposed regulation has been passed. What effects do you anticipate it will have on the community, the environment, and the economy?",
      "Reflect on Your Learning: Reflect on what you've learned through this project. How has your understanding of administrative law grown? How do you imagine you might interact with administrative law in your own life in the future? Write a reflection on your findings, your process, and what you've learned."
