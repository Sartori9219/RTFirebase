    "Project objective": "Intellectual Property Law",
    "Steps": [
      "Understanding Intellectual Property Law: Start by researching the basics of intellectual property law. Understand the different types, such as copyright, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, and why protecting intellectual property is important.",
      "Dive Deeper into Each Type: Spend time on each type of intellectual property. Learn about what each one protects, the duration of protection, and how one can apply for these protections.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario - The Inventor: Imagine you're a young inventor who has created a new kind of eco-friendly scooter. You want to ensure that your invention is protected and that you get the credit and potential financial benefits from your creation.",
      "Identifying the Suitable Intellectual Property Protection: Given your scenario, decide what type of intellectual property protection would be most appropriate for your invention. For example, a patent might be the right choice for a unique invention like an eco-friendly scooter.",
      "The Process of Applying for a Patent: Based on your choice, research and outline the process of applying for that type of protection. This doesn't have to be country-specific, but should give a general idea of what steps you'd need to take to secure a patent for your scooter.",
      "Trademark Creation: Now, imagine you're going to start selling your scooter under a particular brand name. Create a unique brand name and logo, and explore the process of registering it as a trademark.",
      "Understanding Infringement: Research what would constitute as an infringement of your intellectual property rights, and what actions you could take if someone were to infringe on your rights.",
      "Addressing Hypothetical Infringements: Imagine a competitor has released a product that's very similar to yours and is using a brand name and logo that's almost identical to yours. Outline what steps you'd take in response to this situation, based on your understanding of intellectual property law.",
      "Exploring Famous Intellectual Property Disputes: Research a few famous intellectual property disputes. These could be recent news stories or landmark legal cases. Write a short summary of each dispute, including the parties involved, the issue at hand, and the outcome (if it has been resolved).",
      "Reflect on Your Learning: Write a reflection on what you've learned through this project. What were the most interesting parts? What was challenging? How do you think understanding intellectual property law might be useful to you or others in the future? This reflection will help consolidate your learning and demonstrate your understanding of the topic."
