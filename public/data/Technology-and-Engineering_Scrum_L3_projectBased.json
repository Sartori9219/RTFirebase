    "Project objective": "Hypothetical Scenario Creation: Imagine a small town that wants to improve its recycling program. The town council has tasked you with designing a new recycling system that adapts to the changing needs of the community.",
    "Steps": [
      "Goal Setting: Write down your main objectives for the recycling system, including increasing recycling rates, reducing contamination, and educating the public about recycling best practices.",
      "Data Collection: Research and gather data on the current recycling habits and challenges faced by the town. Look for information on recycling rates, common contaminants, and public opinions about recycling.",
      "Iteration Planning: Based on the gathered data, create a list of potential improvements for the recycling system. Prioritize these improvements based on their potential impact on the recycling program.",
      "First Iteration: Choose the top improvement from your list and develop a plan to implement it. This might include creating educational materials, organizing community cleanups, or improving recycling bin designs.",
      "Monitoring and Feedback: Set up a system to collect feedback on the implemented improvement. This could include surveys, interviews, or tracking recycling statistics.",
      "Analyze and Adjust: Analyze the feedback and determine whether the improvement was successful. If necessary, make adjustments to the plan based on the results.",
      "Iterate and Improve: Repeat steps 6 through 8 for each of the remaining improvements on your list, continually refining the recycling system based on the feedback and results.",
      "Presentation: Create a presentation that summarizes your research, hypothetical scenario, objectives, improvements, and the results of each iteration. Share this presentation with your classmates or friends to help them understand the Empirical Process Control concept and how it was applied to the recycling program scenario."
