    "Project objective": "Discovering Belief Systems: A Journey Across Continents and Cultures",
    "Steps": [
      "Define Your Terms: Begin by defining each concept: Monotheism, Polytheism, Atheism, Agnosticism, and Theism. Use reputable online sources like encyclopedias or educational websites to get accurate definitions.",
      "Mind Map: Create a mind map for each concept, illustrating key elements, beliefs, major world religions that fall under each, etc. You could use digital tools like 'MindMup' or 'Coggle'.",
      "Case Studies: Choose one religion or belief system representative of each concept. For example, Christianity for Monotheism, Hinduism for Polytheism, Buddhism for Atheism, Agnostic Theism for Agnosticism, and Deism for Theism.",
      "Research: Conduct an in-depth study of each selected religion/belief system, focusing on their history, teachings, central figures, main texts, etc.",
      "Field Trips: Visit places of worship in your local area that represent these belief systems (if possible). Take pictures, write notes, and even interview members (with permission, of course).",
      "Document: Write a two-page document about each belief system based on your research and observations. Be sure to cite your sources correctly.",
      "Infographics: Create an infographic for each belief system, highlighting key facts, figures, symbols, etc. Use online tools like 'Canva' or 'Piktochart'.",
      "Interactive Quiz: Design a short, fun interactive quiz about these belief systems to check your peers' understanding. Tools like 'Kahoot!' or 'Quizlet' could be very useful.",
      "Presentation: Now, consolidate all your research, mind maps, infographics, and the quiz into a digital presentation using PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Prezi."

    "Project objective": "Spiritual Safari: Unearthing Unconventional Belief Systems",
    "Steps": [
      "Understanding the Concepts: Start by defining each belief system: Deism, Pantheism, Animism, and the concepts of Reincarnation and Karma. Make sure you're clear on these before you start creating your film.",
      "Animation or Illustration: Choose an online tool for creating animated videos, like 'Powtoon' or 'Animaker'. Alternatively, if you're more comfortable with drawing, you can illustrate scenes from your storyboard and scan them to create a film.",
      "Voiceover: Record a voiceover to go along with your video. You could use the built-in microphone on your computer or a separate microphone if you have one. Try to keep your voice clear and engaging.",
      "Add Music: Add some non-copyrighted background music to your film. This will keep your audience interested and help set the tone of your video.",
      "Research: Research and include real-world examples of these belief systems in action. Use credible sources and reference them in your film.",
      "Quiz: Create a quiz based on the content of your film."
