    "Project objective": "Reviving Utopia: The Ultimate Urban Planner\u2019s Challenge",
    "Steps": [
      "Imagine what you want Utopia to look like. Consider how you can incorporate sustainable development, public transportation, walkability, mixed-use development, green spaces and parks, and affordable housing.",
      "Design a public transportation and bicycle infrastructure plan that enhances mobility, reduces carbon emissions, and encourages walking and cycling.",
      "Draw up a zoning map that demonstrates the implementation of mixed-use development, integrating residential, commercial, cultural, and institutional uses.",
      "Identify parts of Utopia that hold historical significance. Create a plan for their preservation and integration into the new urban design.",
      "Propose a scheme for affordable housing to ensure all residents of Utopia have a place to call home, regardless of their income.",
      "Using the principles of smart growth, design an urban redevelopment plan that fosters sustainable economic development and reduces sprawl.",
      "Plan for the city's infrastructure considering aspects like utilities, waste management, and digital connectivity.",
      "Lastly, draft an environmental impact assessment for your proposed developments. Evaluate how your plans will affect the environment and propose mitigation strategies where necessary."
