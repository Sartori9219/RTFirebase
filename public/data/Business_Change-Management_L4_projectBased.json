    "Project objective": "Change Management",
    "Steps": [
      "Understanding Change Management: Start by learning what change management is. Understand its importance in organizations, and familiarize yourself with different models of change management such as Kotter's 8-Step Change Model or Lewin's Change Management Model.",
      "Exploring Case Studies: Look for case studies online of how organizations have implemented change management. These case studies can help illustrate the principles you've learned and show you how they're applied in real-world situations.",
      "Hypothetical Scenario - The Student Council Leader: Imagine that you are the leader of your school's student council. You want to introduce a new digital platform for students to communicate, share ideas, and plan events. But you know that people can resist change, so you'll need a good change management plan.",
      "Identifying the Need for Change: Start by clearly defining why this change is necessary. What are the problems with the current situation? How will this new platform improve communication and event planning?",
      "Envisioning the Change: Describe what the successful implementation of the new platform would look like. How will it function? What impact will it have on the school community?",
      "Creating a Change Management Plan: Using the principles and models of change management that you've learned, create a plan for introducing this new digital platform. This should include communicating the need for change, rallying support, overcoming resistance, implementing the change, and reinforcing the benefits of the new platform.",
      "Overcoming Resistance: Consider potential resistance to this change. Who might resist it and why? How will you address these concerns and work to overcome resistance?",
      "Implementing the Change: Describe how you would implement the new platform. Would it be a sudden change or a gradual transition? Who would need to be involved, and what would their roles be?",
      "Evaluating Success: Define what success will look like for this change. How will you know if the new platform is working well and achieving the desired improvements? What metrics will you look at?",
      "Reflection and Learning: Reflect on what you have learned through this project about change management. How might you apply these principles in future situations, whether in school, at work, or in other parts of your life? Write a summary of your project and your reflections."
